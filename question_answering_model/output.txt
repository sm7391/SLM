Question: What does the code demonstrate in the summary?
Context: 
    This code demonstrates how to build a simple Question Answering system using a pre-trained BERT model. The model is fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset, which enables it to answer questions based on any given text. The system takes two inputs: a book's context (a paragraph or excerpt) and a user-provided question. It tokenizes both inputs, runs them through the BERT model, and extracts the most likely answer. The result is printed and saved to a text file, which includes the question, context, and answer. This implementation provides a simple yet effective way to retrieve answers from large text sources, such as books.
